                            <h3>A Little About Us</h3>
                            <p>Snap Credit Solutions was launched in 2012 with a mission to make receiving capital for small businesses possible. We had one strategy in mind â€“ to make receiving working capital simple, intuitive and human. The challenge of meeting the daily demands of your business and making your business stand out in a competitive marketplace requires money. Getting approved for a loan through a bank or other types of payday companies can be a daunting task. Snap Credit Solutions has found a way to work around these challenges. Our funding approval process is centered around our customers, using the power of technology. Over 90% of our customers  are approved for funding, using our simple, user-friendly application process.</p>
                            <strong>In business, we focus on 3 things.</strong>
